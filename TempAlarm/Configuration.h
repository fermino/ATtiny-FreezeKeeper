	/**
	 * OneWireSwitches configuration
	 * This lib allows us to read a lot of switches using only one analog input. 
	 * It uses a simple voltage divider multiplexed with every switch. 
	 * 
	 * Then: 
	 * 1. Put a resistor (R2) between the analog pin and GND. 
	 * 2. Put a resistor (R1s) between the output of every
	 *    switch and the analog pin. 
	 *    The other side of the switch should be tied to VCC. 
	 * 3. Configure it all here, including the resistor tolerance, 
	 *    multiplied by 10 (usually 50 (5%))
	 * 
	 * The library will make the calculations and now you can read all those
	 * switches by using readKey(R1Index). R1 index is the number of resistor
	 * configured here, starting off by 0. 
	 * 
	 * See https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers if you want
	 * to understand how this all works!
