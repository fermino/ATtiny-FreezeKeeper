# ATtiny-TempAlarm
A programable temperature alarm with ATtiny85, DS18B20 temperature sensor and Grove Serial LCD

## Known bugs
If the sensor is working with parasite power, the VCC pin should be tied to ground, but, because the Greek Gods hate me, it returns 85 Â°C (that seems to be an error code). 
Maybe we are scheduling more conversions that the module can handle when working with parasite power. I remember some datasheet saying that while converting in parasite power mode, no communication should be made.
